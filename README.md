1)   There are no bugs or errors in my code. 

2) I used the following youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PxaTPZIYmc
3) I would seperate this table into college educated and not college educated. I would add an id column, something that would allow me to distinctly seperate each row of data. I would remove the education num, it is a duplicate of the education column.
4) I had issues with setting up my database and importing the csv. Writing the SQL was not a problem, as I have some experience with it.
